[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) has transformed how we approach computing, offering a powerful and affordable platform for countless projects. Now, with XFrames' new native Node.js support, you can unlock even more potential. Create high-performance graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with React while taking full advantage of the Raspberry Pi's capabilities.

### Why XFrames is a Perfect Fit for Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi devices excel in lightweight, efficient computing environments, but traditional GUI frameworks often introduce unnecessary overhead. XFrames takes a different approach: a DOM-free architecture powered by native Node.js, optimized for GPU rendering and lean execution. This ensures your applications are as responsive and resource-efficient as possible.

**What You Can Do with XFrames on Raspberry Pi**

- **Native Node.js Support**: Harness the power of Node.js to create performant applications without the complexity of browser-based engines.
- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Leverage the Pi's GPU for smooth and responsive GUIs.
- **React and Yoga Layouts**: Build modern, flexible interfaces with familiar tools.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Code on your desktop, deploy on your Raspberry Pi seamlessly.

### The Next Steps
This release is just the beginning for Raspberry Pi support in XFrames. We're committed to refining the experience, enhancing performance, and introducing new features tailored to Pi developers.
