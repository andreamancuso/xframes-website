Building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) has always been a balancing act—developers want performance, flexibility, and simplicity, yet most tools force compromises. That’s why I created XFrames, a library designed to address these challenges and empower developers to build high-performance, cross-platform applications without relying on traditional web engines.

## Why XFrames?

The idea for XFrames was born out of frustration with existing solutions like Electron. While Electron revolutionized desktop app development, its reliance on Chromium makes applications heavier than necessary. This approach often consumes excessive resources, especially on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi.

With XFrames, I wanted to create something different:

- A library that doesn’t rely on a browser engine.
- A solution optimized for GPU rendering, capable of harnessing modern hardware effectively.
- A developer-friendly environment powered by **React** and **Yoga layouts**, enabling flexibility and a seamless transition for React developers.

## What Makes XFrames Unique?

- **DOM-Free Architecture**: Unlike traditional frameworks, XFrames eliminates the browser DOM, reducing resource usage and improving performance.
- **Cross-Platform by Design**: Whether you're targeting desktop, Raspberry Pi, or future platforms, XFrames ensures consistency.
- **Native Node.js and React Integration**: Build GUIs using familiar JavaScript tools without sacrificing performance.
- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Bring your interfaces to life with smoother animations and faster refresh rates.
- **WebAssembly (WASM) Compatibility**: While native Node.js powers platforms like Raspberry Pi, XFrames also supports running in browsers through **WASM**, broadening its reach and versatility.

## The Road Ahead

XFrames is still in its early days, but the potential is immense. Here's what’s next:

- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improving support for screen readers and assistive technologies.
- **Expanded Platform Support**: Beyond Raspberry Pi, the goal is to target additional devices and environments.
- **Developer Tools and Demos**: Offering examples, templates, and tools to simplify onboarding.
- **Community Collaboration**: Fostering a vibrant community to help shape XFrames' evolution.

## Who Should Use XFrames?

XFrames is ideal for developers looking for a lightweight, efficient alternative to Electron. Whether you’re building a desktop app, prototyping an IoT interface, or developing software for embedded systems, XFrames provides a modern foundation.

## Join the Journey

This is just the beginning of what I hope will be a transformative journey in GUI development. If you’re interested in contributing, exploring, or just staying updated, check out the documentation and follow the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreamancuso/xframes).

Let’s build something amazing together.
