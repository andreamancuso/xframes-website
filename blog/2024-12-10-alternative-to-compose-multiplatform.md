If you find **Compose Multiplatform** too heavy for your needs, [XFrames for Kotlin](https://github.com/xframes-project/xframes-kotlin) offers a **leaner**, more **flexible** approach to building native applications. By combining the **Compose Runtime** with **XFrames JNI**, you get native performance with a minimalist design. With **Yoga layouts** and easy integration of **native code**, XFrames is perfect for developers who want a **powerful** yet **lightweight** framework without unnecessary bloat.

### 1. **Harnessing the Power of Compose Runtime**

One of the standout features of XFrames is its use of **Compose Runtime**. Unlike full Compose Multiplatform, which often comes with additional complexity and dependencies, XFrames focuses on a **core, lean implementation** of declarative UI principles. This ensures you get the **performance benefits** of Compose without the **overhead**, keeping your development process fast and your applications lightweight.

XFrames makes it easy to build reactive UIs while maintaining **maximum control** over how your app behaves, allowing you to create highly performant, native applications without the extra bloat that can come with other frameworks.

### 2. **XFrames JNI: Native Interoperability Made Simple**

Another key advantage of XFrames is its **JNI support**, enabling you to seamlessly integrate **native C/C++ code** into your Kotlin application. This gives you the ability to write **performance-critical code** and **low-level system integrations** while interacting smoothly with your Kotlin and Compose Runtime code.

With **JNI integration**, you can take full advantage of your system’s capabilities, interacting directly with hardware, libraries, or legacy systems. This kind of deep **native interoperability** is something many higher-level frameworks struggle to provide, making XFrames an ideal solution for developers who need **maximum flexibility** and **performance**.

### 3. **Yoga Layouts: Flexible, Responsive UIs**

XFrames leverages **Yoga**, a powerful **flexbox-based layout system** designed for building **flexible, responsive UIs**. Yoga allows you to manage layouts effectively, without needing to deal with complex or bloated UI systems. Whether you're developing an app for **desktop** or **cross-platform** environments, Yoga simplifies layout management by providing **easy-to-understand** rules for how your UI components should adjust to different screen sizes and orientations.

Yoga is a great tool for developers who want control over their UI without complicating things—allowing for more **predictable** and **easier-to-maintain layouts** that just work, no matter the platform.

### 4. **A Lightweight Framework for Maximum Performance**

One of the key reasons to choose XFrames over Compose Multiplatform is the **lean architecture**. Compose Multiplatform can often feel like overkill for simple projects, with its heavy reliance on external libraries and complex configurations. In contrast, XFrames provides a **minimalist**, streamlined framework that removes unnecessary abstractions and focuses on delivering the best performance without the extra weight.

XFrames' **lightweight** approach means faster load times, reduced memory usage, and quicker iteration cycles—ideal for developers who need **performance** but don’t want to compromise on flexibility or power.

### Conclusion: Lightweight, Powerful, and Flexible

For developers who want the benefits of **native performance**, **flexible layouts**, and **easy integration with native systems**, XFrames offers a compelling alternative to Compose Multiplatform. By leveraging the **Compose Runtime** and **XFrames JNI**, developers can build **lean, efficient applications** without sacrificing power or flexibility. Whether you're building a desktop application or an app that requires native performance, XFrames provides the right balance of **simplicity** and **power**—making it the perfect tool for your next project.

Start building your next native application today with XFrames and discover the difference that a **lightweight** yet **powerful** framework can make.
